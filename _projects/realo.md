I joined Realo in the winter of 2014. As the only designer on the team, my job was to create a design system flexible enough to be used on a variety of platforms. This was a project with lots of challenges and pitfalls because of the sheer amount of screens and scenarios a user can find themselves in. Together with Bregt Colpaert, my Head of Product, I created a design that's universal in terms of design language while at the same time has a unique style.

Realo has been built with a mobile-first approach from the start. By using this approach, we make sure the site loads fast on mobile devices while still providing a complete package in terms of feature set. Nearly every feature on desktop is available on a smartphone, thanks to some clever design decisions. I worked very closely with our engineering (frontend and backend) teams to make sure the design is consistent and implemented well.

Over the course of almost a year, I learned a lot on how to work effectively in a multilingual team. Since I had a tight deadline every week, I had to manage my time and stay focused.
