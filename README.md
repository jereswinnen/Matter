## Disclaimer
While I’m primarily a product designer, I do enjoy coding up the designs and interfaces I create. Some of the code you’re seeing here may contain some faults and not-so-clever ways of doing things, but this is something I do on the side.

I feel like I’m constantly improving my coding skills, so that’s a good thing, right?
