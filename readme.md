The bread and butter of my online identity, Matter.

## Information
All the code that lives inside this repository is hand-written by me, Jeremy Swinnen. I’m a product designer living in Belgium.

## Libraries Used
- Neat: [http://neat.bourbon.io]: http://neat.bourbon.io

## Future Updates
Below is a list of things I’d like to improve over time:

1. Write my own grid system
2. Become more fluent with [BEM]: http://getbem.com.

## Disclaimer
While I’m primarily a designer, I do enjoy coding up the designs and interfaces I create. Some of the code you’re seeing here may contain some faults and not-so-clever ways of doing things but,  this is something I do on the side.

I feel like I’m constantly improving my coding skills, so that’s a good thing, right?
