<p>While I’m primarily a designer, I do enjoy coding up the designs and interfaces I create. Some of the code you’re seeing here may contain some faults and not-so-clever ways of doing things but, this is something I do on the side.</p>

<p>I feel like I’m constantly improving my coding skills, so that’s a good thing, right?</p>
