My name is Jeremy Swinnen, I'm a freelance product designer and creative developer based in [Antwerp, Belgium](https://goo.gl/maps/igSsnqybjE82). I focus on user interface design and frontend web development. I've been interested in design for as long as I can remember and I've been doing this as my job for the past 10 years. Recently, I went freelance full-time.

Through visually pleasing design and modular code, I translate people's ideas into award-winning products. I find tremendous value in the ability to code my designs and create interactive prototypes throughout the design process.

My work has been featured numerous times in local and international publications. A few of the apps I designed were also featured by Apple in the App Store.
