I've been interested in design for as long as I can remember and I've been doing this professionally for the past 8 years. Through visually pleasing design and modular design systems, I translate your ideas into award-winning products. I've also been lucky to have my work featured numerous times in local and international publications.

You can find me all over the internet&mdash;I post bite-sized on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jereswinnen), push work-in-progress pixels on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/jereswinnen) and, deploy code on [Github](https://github.com/jereswinnen).
